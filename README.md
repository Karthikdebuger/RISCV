# 📘 RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program Documentation

Welcome to my documentation repository for the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, where I track and document my **weekly progress** on tasks assigned as part of the program.  
This repository serves as a **complete logbook** of my journey, learnings, and outcomes while building towards a **silicon tapeout using open-source EDA tools**.

## 📖 About RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is a hands-on initiative aimed at:

- 🖥️ Learning **RISC-V architecture** and **SoC (System-on-Chip) development**  
- 🛠️ Exploring **RTL-to-GDSII flows** using open-source EDA tools  
- 📐 Understanding **RTL design, verification, synthesis, placing & routing, static timing analysis, and DRC/LVS**  
- 🚀 Preparing a **tapeout-ready design** that mimics **real-world industry flows**

This program emphasizes **open-source methodologies** and gives participants an opportunity to experience the **end-to-end chip design cycle**.
